## 🧩 Code Guidelines

Follow our feature-first structure (see README.md).

Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, files, and branches.

Keep PRs focused: fix a bug, add a feature, or improve docs — but don’t mix unrelated changes.

Write clear commit messages:

feat(auth): add Google OAuth login
fix(wallet): correct token balance rounding issue
docs: improve installation guide

For major features, create an issue first and discuss before starting.

## 🧪 Testing

Test locally before opening a pull request:

flutter run

Prefer writing small unit tests or widget tests if you add logic.

Make sure the app builds cleanly (flutter analyze and flutter test).

1. Push your branch:

git push origin feat/your-feature-name
