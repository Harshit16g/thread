# TabL Super-App

**TabL** is a next-generation, decentralized super-app built with Flutter. Our vision is to create a secure, peer-to-peer ecosystem where users can seamlessly offer and consume services, manage community news, and participate in a native token economy.

This project is built with a focus on security, scalability, and a developer-friendly workflow, leveraging a modern tech stack centered around Flutter and Supabase.
